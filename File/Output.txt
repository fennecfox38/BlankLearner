But __ anyone was _______ on that ________, the most likely _________ is Leonardo da Vinci, a man whose ________ ___ many _____ had been to ___ like a ____. Some 50 years later, an ____________, Gerolamo Cardano, wrote, "Leonardo da Vinci..._________ to fly, but ______. He was and _________ painter."
 To call Leonardo an excellent painter is like labeling Shakespeare a clever wordsmith. He was a true genius, recognized in his own time and idolized in ours. His paintings are as secret and seductive as himself, done with the hand of an angel, the intellect of a scientist, and the soul of a romantic. His drawings are among the most beautiful ever made; his most treasured painting, the Mona Lisa, is undoubtedly the most famous in the world.
 His love of painting notwithstanding, it was knowledge itself that was Leonardo's great love - knowledge, and the experience from which it may be drawn. To acquire it, Leonardo turned to a diverse array of fields: mathematics, geometry, optics, astronomy, geology, botany, zoology, hydraulics, mechanics, and anatomy, as well as painting and drawing. As an engineer, he could think in four dimensions, visualizing not only the shapes of mechanical parts but also their interrelated motions.
 Among his designs for flight, Leonardo imagined parachutes, landing equipment, even an aerial screw that acted like the blades of a helicopter. But, like so much else in his life, Leonardo's attempts to actually create a workable flying machine are a mystery. There remains only one enigmatic reference, in a notebook characteristically filled with phrases and sketches, in which he proclaims that his great bird "will bring eternal glory to the nest where it was born..."

Birth of a Genius
 Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452, the illegitimate child of a peasant girl named Caterina and respected notary Piero da Vinci. Leonardo lived at first with his mother in a three-room stone house on a hill just outside the village of Vinci, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Florence. In that idyllic Tuscan countryside began the youngster's lifelong love of nature - a love that would remain implicit in all his later works.
 Around 1469 Leonardo's father took him to florence, where the stateman Lorenzo de Medici had established an academy where all arts were honored. For years, art had been an instrument of religious expression, and the parameters of what was ideologically acceptable had been decided by the Church. But in the more tolerant atmosphere of Florence, painters, represented things as they saw them, rather than as the Church said they must be. It was a society well suited to the ever-questioning country boy.
 Leonardo commenced an apprenticeship at the studio of Andrea del Verrocchio, with whom, he studied for at least six years. The boy mastered every medium and continued his studies of nature, discovering so much so fast that it seemed to him that everything must eventually be revealed to his searching. In painting, he not only outshone his more mature colleagues but also his teacher.  Assigned to paint the figure of an angel, he gave it a whole new dimension that drew the viewer directly into the painting, in a way that Verrocchio's inhibited style could never do. Some say that Verrocchio never painted again.

Early MasterWorks
 Leonardo left Florence in 1482 at the age of 30. He stayed away for 18 years. The young Florentine hoped to find the glory he sought in the court of Ludovico Sforza, ruler of Milan. A practical city, Milan cared more for knowledge than for the arts. It housed no great artist but counted many learned men. Leonardo came as a musician but presented himself as an engineer, describing in a long boastful letter his inventiveness in the field of weapons. Almost as an afterthought, he assured Sforza that, "...also I can do in painting whatever may be done, as well as any other, whoever he may be."
 It was as an artist that Leonardo was accepted. He established an art factory much like Verrocchio's shop in Florence and at once accepted assignments. These included a portrait of Sforza's beautiful and learned mistress, Cecilia Gallerani (see page 189, Lady with an Ermine), a portrait of a musician that some scholars believe is really a self-portrait, and a brilliant early version of Virgin of the Rocks, begun in 1483 and now in the Louvre.
 Around 1485 he began his notebooks. These are detailed, cryptic compilations of material on a seemingly arbitrary range of topics, from geology and geometry to anatomy and astronomy, all interwoven and superimposed as one burning interest gave way to the next. His notes are written left-handed from right to left, and there are sketches everywhere that complement his text. His discussions were addressed to himself, leaving us an extraordinary record of the movements of his mind.

Bronze Horse and Last Supper
 Along with his varied duties at court, which ranged from painting to plumbing, two great works mark Leonardo's years with Sforza. One was to be a bronze statue of the duke's late father as a conquering hero riding a horse. The other, ordered by Sforza for his favorite church, was a "Last Supper." The themes were not unlike other commissions of the time, but if the subjects lacked originality, their treatment did not.
 The horse was to be colossal, in a pose full of motion and life. The concept was so bold, so ambitious, that it finally brought the artist the praise he sought. His contemporaries thought it could not be created, but Leonardo devised workable plans. Sadly, he was denied the chance to complete his project. War broke out, and the bronze was used for cannon instead.
 The Last Supper, too, was presented as never before. Leonardo arranged the 13 figures in a brilliant composition reflecting the terrible moment following Christ's words, "One of you shall betray me." He gave the figures deep emotions, varying according to their natures, perfectly illustrating the intention of each subject's soul.
 Unfortunately, Leonardo's brilliance was not matched by his planning. He hated deadlines and fixed schedules; painting fresco (that is, on freshly prepared plaster) imposed both. So he worked with oil mixtures, which could be applied whenever the mood struck him. The technique suited the artist, but not the wall. The paint soon blistered and began to peel away from the damp surface.
 With his doomed masterworks behind him, and with the French army of Louis XII approaching the city, Leonardo left Milan, and in the spring of 1500, he was back in Florence.

Battle of the Giants
 Leonardo came home a famous man. No one knew or cared much about his science and his inventions, but everyone had heard of his horse and his Last Supper.
 Many of his competitors had either died or gone to Rome. His most serious rival was Michelangelo Buonarroti, 23 years his junior, surly, ambitious, and a great painter. The two Florentines hated each other wholeheartedly.
 Once again, two great works drew Leonardo's artistic effort. One was a huge mural for the Council Chamber depicting the Battle of Anghiari, an important political victory for Florence. The other was a life-size portrait of a middle-class woman. He worked on the painting concurrently, the portrait offering him pleasant relief from the subject of the battle.
